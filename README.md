# ctz.digital-front-end-test
A repo to be forked by Front End Dev applicants

The following is a challenge of both front-end functionality and UI/UX. There are no framework/module restrictions, although Clicktripz does work in React with a heavy lean on MUI  ;)
1. Fork this repo
2. Create an app (`create-react-app` is totally fine!) view leveraging the sample `data.json` file to do the following:

## Company Info
  - [ ] display the company name
  - [ ] display the `enabled` status and able to toggle `true | false`
  - [ ] display `testPublisher` status and able to toggle `true | false`
  - [ ] display `timezone` value
  - [ ] display `accountType` value and able to modify (possible values: `CTZero`, `CTLite`, `CTPlus`, `CTPro`)
  - [ ] display the current revenue share and is able to modify as well (range from .1 -> .9)
  - [ ] **BONUS** link to default terms of service with optional uploader for custom terms of service

## Site(s) Info
  - [ ] display siteid
  - [ ] display site name
  - [ ] display site URL
  - [ ] display `enabled` status
  - [ ] display script load delay setting (in milliseconds) with ability to modify
  - [ ] display all active products per device
